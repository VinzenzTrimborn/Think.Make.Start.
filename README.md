A warm welcome on my Github page. For all of you unfamiliar with Github, it is a space where everybody can share work and awesome projects. This Repository/Site gives you a short introduction to my work and is used to introduce myself online. For Think.Make.Start. I decided to give you a link to this site instead of my LinkedIn as it gives you deeper insights into my technical skills, my motivation and provides a chance to get to know me more personal online. 

In the following, I will shortly introduce you to my most exciting projects. After that, I will quickly describe what I am overall excited about so that hopefully you can get to know me online as best as possible. 

## Projects

I began teaching myself and trying out things besides university in Mid 2019 after my 4th bachelors semester. I took 4 months off from university before my exchange semester to Singapur/NTU to learn about autonomous driving cars online. Since an autonomous car is a robot, I did some projects concerning ROS (Robot Operating System) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) with which I trained a car to steer correctly in a simulator based on the pictures of the road. Moreover, I did projects recognizing Traffic Signs with a CNN and fundamental principals of computer vision.

In the end, I had the change to even upload my ROS code on a self-driving car and to let it drive around based on waypoints in a parking lot. 

After my studies at NTU, which were mostly based on Simulation and Business, I got an Internship at KINEXON one of the most exciting IoT Companies in Munich. I worked as part of the Product Management Team, where I gained a lot of insights into the production industry. I learned a lot about the requirements and technical standards and the potential Industrie 4.0 has.

During that time a built a software prototype which might be rolled out within the next year as part of a new product. 

After gaining so many insight into the automation industry, I decided to dive deeper into hardware instead of Information Systems (my current Study program) and applied for a Modular Robotics Masters project. Currently, we are testing robots/sensors, to automate the difficult task of concrete removal in the construction industry. In a small group, we set up a navigation stack and mounted a LIDAR onto a mobile platform to test out the abilities of localization and navigation in foggy/dirty air construction environments. 

Here you see an image of an ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino to retrieve sensor data from it.

## Motivation
Overall, I am mostly motivated about one thing. Motivate people to make the world a bit better by using the amazing technologies and knowledge that are now accessible for humankind. 

Here are some videos which just made me smile and motivate me to become an engineer. 

You should not watch them, if you still have work to do as they really distracted me.
